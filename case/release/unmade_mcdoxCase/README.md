Currently unmade - Ready for any future remakes.

Adjustments after session at MVB hackspace today.
1. Asymmetric hole mistake stops layers being reversible.
  It was off by 5mm but still snapped to grid.
2. Recess for ArduinoProMirco widened by 1mm as it was a very tight press fit.
  This also fixed the very slight asymmetry of the top outline which wasn't
  snapped to grid.
3. Switch hole paths made with straight segments and simplified paths.
  Hope to avoid the odd path planning seen with segments cut in seemingly random
  order.
  It was still the correct cut-points but wasted time flying the lens rather
  than cutting.
4. Pinhole for programming pushbutton through bottom cover.
5. Slightly enlargened keycap cutouts in innerTop to stop caps getting jammed.

DXFs derived from case.svg
--------------------------
```
For each cut layer of case.svg:
  Save a copy as DXF14 using named layer.
  Open DXF in Inkscape.
  Select all, set color to red.
  Reposition for paper size of 400x200mm.

Layout is similar to than of the Ergodox project, but in a unibody case.


Subdirectories
--------------

- keycap - STL model generator written in OpenSCAD suitable for FDM printing.
  Generated models are tracked in `keycap/stl` because it takes a while (~10
  minutes) to generate them.
- release - Stuff that's actually been manufactured.
- pcb/hand - TODO Reversible PCB which connects the switches in a grid.
- pcb/ctrl - TODO Breakout PCB for connecting controller to switch grids.
